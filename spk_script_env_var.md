- `SYNOPKG_PKG_STATUS`: Package status presented by these values: INSTALL, UPGRADE, UNINSTALL, START, STOP or empty.
  - `INSTALL` will be set as the status value in the preinst and postinst scripts while the package is installing. If the user chooses to “start after installation” at the last step of the installation wizard, the value will be set to INSTALL in the start-stop-status script when the package is started.
  - `UPGRADE` will be set as the status value in the preupgrade, preuninst, postunist, preinst, postinst and postupgrade scripts sequentially while the package is upgrading. If the package has already started before upgrade, the value will be set to UPGRADE in the start-stop-status script when the package is started or stopped.
  - `UNINSTALL` will be set as the status value in the preuninst and postunist scripts while the package is un-installing. If the package has already started before un-installation, the value will be set to UNINSTALL in the start-stop-status script when the package is stopped.
  - If the user starts or stops a package in the Package Center, START or STOP will be set as the status value in the start-stop-status script.
  - When the NAS is booting up or shutting down, its status value will be empty.
- `SYNOPKG_OLD_PKGVER`: Old package version which is defined in INFO during upgrading.
- `SYNOPKG_TEMP_SPKFILE`: The location of package spk file is temporarily stored in DS when the package is installing/upgrading.

  Note:
  - The progress value is between 0 and 1.
  - Example:

    ```shell

    ```
